# SVD Image Compression

> Image compression based on the _singular value decomposition_ (SVD)

## Introduction

The main result in Section 12.3 in Sauer (2018) says that if $A$ is an $m \times n$ nonzero, real matrix, it can be factorized as

$$
A= U \Sigma V^T,
$$

where $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal matrices of dimensions $m \times m$ and $n \times n$, respectively, and where $\Sigma$ is an $m \times n$ "diagonal" matrix of the form...

The factorization $A= U \Sigma V^T$ is called the _singular value decomposition_ (SVD) of $A$.
